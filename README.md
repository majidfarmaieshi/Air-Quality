# Air-Quality
1. INTRODUCTION In this project, we discuss the analysis of the dataset “air quality”, that represent Contains the responses of a gas multisensory device deployed on the field in an Italian city Contains the responses of a gas multisensory device deployed on the field in an Italian city. Hourly responses averages are recorded along with gas concentrations references from a certified analyzer. with the goal of studying the similarity between the time series and discovering interesting sequential patterns. Instead, for the analysis of alternative classification methods and outlier detection, we used the dataset “The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device.
